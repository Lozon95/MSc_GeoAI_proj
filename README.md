# MSc Project – GeoAI Soil Classification

This repository contains a MSc course project in Geospatial AI.  
The project explores soil classification using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and **transfer learning with VGG16**.  

## 📂 Structure
- `src/` – Python scripts for preprocessing, augmentation, and model training  
- `docs/` – Report (PDF) explaining background, methods, and results  

## ⚠️ Note
The code is intentionally over-commented for educational purposes.  
For production use, comments should follow [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) guidelines.  

## 🔧 Methods
- Image preprocessing and augmentation  
- Class balancing with weights  
- Transfer learning with VGG16  
- Fine-tuning for improved accuracy  

## 🎓 Context
Originally developed as part of the GeoAI course at Lund University.
